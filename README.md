# About 
Terrorism is one of the biggest global challenges faced by humanity, killing and wounding millions of people, and responsible for the long-term destruction of wealth opportunities and the well-being of people. Our project is an attempt to dig deep into data to find out the possible ways to prevent terror attacks, initiatives that can be taken for the short and long term for tackling global terrorism, and changing trends in terror attacks to effectively plan mitigation measures for the future.
# Objective
By the end we will conclude the study with following Insights:-

Which countries were most attacked?
Which regions were affected the most?
Is there an increase or decrease in recent years?
Is there an increase or decrease in the number of successful terror operations?
Who are the most targeted globally and regionally?
What are the most common types of attacks globally and regionally?
What are the most used weapon types globally and regionally?
Which terrorist organization is responsible for the majority number of attacks? By analyzing these questions, the end goal is to come up with short-term and long-term solutions to stop and tackle terrorism.
